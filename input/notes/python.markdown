<toc />

A long line can be split into two lines by ending the first line with a backslash `\`. Python also automatically joins adjacent lines if an open parentheses `(`, bracket `[`, or brace `{` hasn't been closed. Lines after the first physical line are _continuation lines_. Indentation rules only apply to the first physical line and not to continuation lines.

By convention, an identifier starting with a single leading underscore `_` indicates that it's meant to be private, while an identifier starting with two leading underscores indicates a strongly private identifier, but if it also ends in two underscores it usually indicates a language-defined special name.

Note that although a set literal is expressed as `{a, b}`, the literal `{}` denotes an empty _dictionary_, not an empty set. An empty set has no literal syntax, but can be expressed as `set()`.
