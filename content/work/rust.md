Rust is a modern systems programming language that emphasizes memory safety and safe concurrency.

I was an early Rust user since a little before 2014, when Rust was in a constant state of flux as the language wasn't finalized. I would constantly help adapt Rust ecosystem packages to the latest syntax and semantics. I also [reported many early Rust compiler errors](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aissue+sort%3Aupdated-desc+author%3Ablaenk+is%3Aclosed) that I discovered by using bleeding-edge nightly features, all of which were promptly fixed.

During the crunch leading up to the 1.0 release, Rust core developers specifically reached out to me for my insight and opinions on the redesign of the file system module of the standard library because I was a noted early user and contributor to the Rust ecosystem.

Immediately after the redesign I noticed an edge-case that was not being covered and promptly fixed it in time for the 1.0 release.
