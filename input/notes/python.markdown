<toc />

A long line can be split into two lines by ending the first line with a backslash `\`. Python also automatically joins adjacent lines if an open parentheses `(`, bracket `[`, or brace `{` hasn't been closed. Lines after the first physical line are _continuation lines_. Indentation rules only apply to the first physical line and not to continuation lines.
