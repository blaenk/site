## Diphthongs

A _diphthong_ is a succession of two vowels in a single syllable. Examples include _how_ \[aυ\], _boy_ \[ɔi\], and _time_ \[ai\].

| aa, ee, oo, eu | always long                             |
| ie, oe, uu     | only long before "r", otherwise shorter |

# Combinations

| Combination | Example                            | Pronunciation                    |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| -oude-      | houden, oude, schrouder            | colloquially pronounced _ouwe_   |
| -ijde-      | rijden, snijden                    | colloquially pronounced _ije_    |
| -lijk       | dagelijks, gemakkelijke, tijdelijk | pronounced like _er_ in _father_ |

# Spelling

A _closed syllable_ is one that ends in a consonant and an _open syllable_ is one that ends in a vowel.

Double-lettered vowels are written in closed syllables, and single-lettered in open syllables.

If there are two consonants between the vowels, syllable division divides them, as with _mannen_ -> _man-nen_ and _armen_ -> _ar-men_.

If there is one consonant between the vowels, syllable division comes before the consonant so that the first one is an open syllable, as with _bomen_ -> _bo-men_ and _deuren_ -> _deu-ren_.

With words that end in _f_ or _s_ such as _brief_ or _huis_, adding an ending such that the end consonant becomes the first consonant of the following syllable usually causes it to be replaced by _v_ or _z_ respectively, unless the _s_ is preceded by a _p_, _t_, or _k_.

| Before  | After   |
| ------- | ------- |
| raaf    | raven   |
| wolf    | wolven  |
| huis    | huizen  |
| rups    | rupsen  |
| fietsen | fietsen |

When adding an ending such as _-e_, _-en_, or _-er_ to a word containing a vowel spelled with two letters, a consonant is attached as well and one of the two letters in the vowel is considered superfluous and removed. For example _maat_ -> _maten_. This is because _maat_ would become _maaten_ which is divided into syllables _maa-ten_, so that the extra _a_ in _aa_ in _maa_ is superfluous. Note that this is reversed to arrive at the _ik_ conjugation of a verb, so _eten_ becomes _eet_ since _eet_ would become _eten_, or _leren_ becomes _leer_.

On the other hand, if it contains a vowel spelled with one letter, it gets two copies of the attached consonant. For example, _mat_ -> _matten_. This is because _mat_ would become _maten_ but a one-letter vowel attaches to its consonant, which would divide into syllables _mat-en_, so to make that divide equally as described above, an extra _t_ is added to become _mat-ten_.

# De vs Het

It's important to learn whether _de_ or _het_ is used for a given noun because of its consequence in terms of possessives, question words, demonstratives, adjectives, and relative pronouns.

## De

* plural nouns
    * het kind (the child)
    * de kinderen (the children)
* professions
    * de leraar (the teacher)
* often for people with an identified gender
    * de vader (the father)
    * de dochter (the daughter)
* vegetables, fruits, trees, plants, mountains, rivers
* written-out numbers and letters
    * de drie (the three)
    * de a (the 'a')
* most words ending with:
    * -ie
    * -ij
    * -heid
    * -teit
    * -schap
    * -tie
    * -sie
    * -aar
    * -eur
    * -er
    * -or

## Het

* diminutive, which are usually words ending with:
    * -je
    * -tje
    * -etje
    * -pje
    * -mpje
* words with two syllables and starting with:
    * be-
    * ge-
    * ver-
    * ont-
* verbs used as nouns. when the infinitive form is used as a noun:
    * het lopen van de hond (the walking of the dog)
* languages, names of metals
* names of compass points
    * het noorden (the North)
* names of sports and games
    * het schaken (chess)
    * het voetbal (football)
* words ending with:
    * -isme
    * -ment

# Pronouns

| English        | Dutch    |
| -------------- | -------- |
| I              | Ik       |
| You (singular) | Je / Jij |
| He             | Hij      |
| She            | Ze / Zij |
| It             | Het      |
| You (formal)   | U        |
| We             | We / Wij |
| You (plural)   | Jullie   |
| They           | Ze / Zij |

## Stress

There are stressed (marked) and unstressed (unmarked) pronouns. Stressed pronouns receive emphasis.

| Unstressed | Stressed |
| ---------- | -------- |
| Je         | Jij      |
| Ze         | Zij      |
| We         | Wij      |

Even though they are less used than unmarked pronouns, some situations such as comparisons force the emphasis of the pronoun, as it would be unnatural to use the unstressed form.

TODO: me/mij, je/jou, je/jouw

## Object Pronouns

There are stressed and unstressed object pronouns.

| English          | Unstressed | Stressed         |
| ---------------- | ---------- | ---------------- |
| me               | me         | mij              |
| you (singular)   | je         | jou              |
| you (formal)     | u          | u                |
| him              | hem        | hem              |
| her              | haar       | haar             |
| it               | het        | Note 1           |
| us               | ons        | ons              |
| you (plural)     | jullie     | jullie           |
| them (persons)   | ze         | hun/hen (Note 2) |
| them (inanimate) | ze         | Note 1           |

Note 1: Stressed "it" uses a demonstrative pronoun

Note 2:  
After a preposition or as the direct object use _hen_.

As the indirect object, use _hun_.

When in doubt it's easiest and always correct to use the unstressed _ze_.

_Onze_ is used for _de_ words while _ons_ is used for _het_ words.

Independent possessives don't precede a noun and must include _de_ or _het_ depending on the noun being referred to.

| English          | Dutch                |
| ---------------- | -------------------- |
| mine             | de/het mijne         |
| yours (singular) | de/het jouwe         |
| yours (formal)   | de/het uwe           |
| his              | de/het zijne         |
| hers             | de/het hare          |
| its              | Note 1               |
| ours             | de/het onze (Note 2) |
| yours (plural)   | Note 1               |
| theirs           | de/het hunne         |

Note 1: Dutch doesn't have independent possessives for "its" and plural "yours"

Note 2: First-person plural independent possessive no longer has the distinction between _de_ and _het_. It is always _onze_.

## Alternative Possessive

The word _van_ can be used to say that something belongs to someone.

| English          | Dutch      |
| ---------------- | ---------- |
| mine             | van mij    |
| yours (singular) | van jou    |
| yours (formal)   | van u      |
| his              | van hem    |
| hers             | van haar   |
| its              | Note 1     |
| ours             | van ons    |
| yours (plural)   | van jullie |
| theirs           | van hen    |

Note: To indicate that something belongs to "it" say _ervan_ or with stress _hiervan_.

# Verbs

Infinitive forms of verbs end in _-en_ such as _eten_ (to drink) and _drinken_ (to drink). This suffix shouldn't be confused with the _-en_ appended to plural nouns.

A verb's _stem_ is usually obtained by removing the _-en_ suffix from the infinitive.

Verbs are usually conjugated by identifying the stem and appending the appropriate conjugation suffix.

| Pronoun         | Conjugation | Example               |
| --------------- | ----------- | --------------------- |
| Ik              | \[stem\]      | Ik drink/houd         |
| Jij             | \[stem\] + t  | Jij drinkt/houdt      |
| Hij / Zij / Het | \[stem\] + t  | Hij drinkt/houdt      |
| U               | \[stem\] + t  | U drinkt/houdt        |
| Wij             | infinitive  | Wij drinken/houden    |
| Jullie          | infinitive  | Jullie drinken/houden |
| Zij             | infinitive  | Zij drinken/houden    |

## Irregular Verbs

There are only 6 verbs that are completely irregular, though there are others that aren't entirely regular in the past tense.

The irregular verbs are:

* Hebben (to have)
* Kunnen (can)
* Mogen (may)
* Willen (to want)
* Zijn (to be)
* Zullen (shall)

# Adverbs

Usually adverbs come after the verb.

If the verb has an object (person or thing receiving the action of the verb) then the adverb comes before or after the object, depending on whether it is definite or indefinite.

A definite object is a definite pronoun (me/mij, je/jou, etc.) or a noun with a definite article (de, het) or possessive (mijn, jouw, etc.). Adverbs usually come _after_ a definite object.

* Ik eet de boterham nu.

An indefinite object is an indefinite pronoun (iets, iemand, etc.) or noun with an indefinite article (een) or no article. Adverbs always come _before_ an indefinite object.

* Ik eet nu een boterham.

Note that it's also possible to place an adverb at the beginning of the sentence for emphasis.

Dutch has a V2 (Verb 2nd) word order, meaning that the verb is always the second element of the sentence, except in yes/no questions and commands.

Even if words are moved to the beginning of a sentence for emphasis, the V2 word order requires that the verb remains in the second place. So if another word is moved to the first place, the verb _switches_ places with the subject. This is known as an _inversion_. Then as with inversions in questions, if the subject is _je_ or _jij_ then the verb loses its _-t_ suffix.

* Ik eet nu een boterham.
* Nu eet ik een boterham.

It's also possible to move objects to the beginning of the sentence for emphasis, which changes the word order to Object-Verb-Subject (OVS).

# Prepositions

"To live" translates to both _wonen_ and _leven_, but the difference is that _wonen_ denotes the place of residence, whereas _leven_ refers to to being alive, existing.

# Conjunctions

## Coordinating Conjunctions

Coordinating conjunctions link two sentences or words of roughly equal importance. Common coordinating conjunctions in Dutch include:

* en
* of
* maar
* want
* dus

## Subordinating Conjunctions

A subordinating conjunction links two clauses that are not equal.

* Contrasting: _hoewel_
* Cause: _omdat_, _doordat_
* Consequence: _als_, _tenzij_
* Time: _terwijl_, _zodra_, _wanneer_, _totdat_, _voordat_
* Providing subclause as an object: _dat_, _of_ (when it means whether/if)

Subordinate clauses use a special word order where the verbs always come at the end.

* Het boek is duur, omdat het oud is.

However, if the subordinate clause is placed _before_ the main clause for emphasis, then the _main_ clause will be inverted: the subject and verb switch places.

* Omdat het oud is, is het boek duur.

Clauses following a coordinating conjunction (_want_, _of_, _dus_) can _never_ be moved to the beginning of the sentence.

# Formality

It is a mistake to capitalize the formal "you" letter _u_ except for deities.

# Negation

_Geen_ is used to negate a noun that is otherwise preceded by _een_, equivalent to "not a". Also used if the noun isn't preceded by an article, such as plurals or uncountable nouns.

Geen can always be translated as "no".

* Is dat een man? Nee, dat is geen man. (That is no man)
* Hebben zij boeken? Nee, zij hebben geen boeken. (They have no books)

_Niet_ is essentially used wherever _geen_ is not: to negate verbs, thoughts, adjectives, adverbs, and other sentence elements that aren't nouns.

Niet comes after the object, unlike geen.

If niet is used to negate an adjective or adverb, it comes directly directly before that word.

# Questions

For questions questions, subject and verb swap places, also known as an _inversion_, so that instead of target-verb it becomes verb-target.

* Hij spreekt Nederlands -> Spreekt hij Nederlands?

If the subject is _je_ or _jij_, the verb loses its _-t_ suffix.

* Je spreekt Nederlands. -> Spreek je Nederlands?

A _closed question_ can only be answered with yes or no. They are often formed with an auxiliary verb like _to do_.

* **Does** he run?
* **Do** I see him?
* Is she ill?

Other times an _inversion_ is applied.

* Will I leave?
* Have we done that?

Dutch only applies inversions to form closed questions.

* Jullie zijn klaar -> You are done
* Zijn jullie klaar -> Are youd one?
* Jij zwemt -> You swim
* Zwem jij? -> Do you swim?

Open questions often start with an interrogative pronoun such as _wie_ (who), _wat_ (what), _waar_ (where).

* Wie is dat?
* Wat doe je?
* Waar kom je vandaan?

# Plurals

Plural forms of nouns can be obtained by adding one of four suffixes:

1. _-en_
2. _-s_
3. _-eren_ (rare)
4. _-a_ for words coming from Latin. can also just add _-s_

Nouns that end in _-s_ replace with _-z_ and _-f_ with _-v_ when turned into plurals, e.g. _muis_ becomes _muizen_.

If a noun ends with a _single_ vowel _except_ _-e_, adding _-s_ can only be done after an added apostrophe `'`. For example, _menu_ becomes _menu's_. _No_ apostrophe is necessary if the noun ends in a single vowel of _-e_.

# Adjectives

An adjective receives an _-e_ suffix if:

* It follows a noun with a definite article _de_ or _het_ (usually):

    * de grote hond
    * het grote huis

* It follows a demonstrative or possessive pronoun:

    * deze oude hond
    * dit oude huis
    * mijn oude hond
    * mijn oude huis

* It precedes a _de_ word and follows indefinite article _een_ or one of:

    * een
    * geen
    * elk
    * genoeg
    * ieder
    * veel
    * wat
    * weinig
    * welk
    * zo'n
    * zulk

If no article comes before a _het_ word then the adjective doesn't get an _-e_ ending.

* koud water

If no article comes before a _de_ word then the adjective does get an _-e_ ending.

* lekkere koffie

Predicate adjectives follow a linking verb like "to be" that describe the subject, such as "green" in "The ball is green."

Predicative adjectives do not receive an _-e_ ending.

* Het huis is groot
* De hond is groot
* De honden zijn duur

Some adjectives don't get any ending, such as:

* adjectives ending in _-en_, including participles of verbs acting as adjectives that end in _-en_
* eigen
* tevreden
* gebroken
* open
* opgewonden
* material adjectives with _-en_
    * gouden
    * houten
    * zilveren
* few without _-en_
    * plastic
    * rubber
* adjectives ending in _-a_ or unstressed _-e_
    * prima
    * roze
* adjectives with orginal numbers in the first part
    * tweedehands
    * derderangs
* rechter
* linker

# Position

In Dutch, something can't just _be_ somewhere. Using the verb "to be" would be very unnatural. Instead, something has to be _standing_, _sitting_, or _lying_ somewhere.

_Zitten_ means "to sit" and is used to describe the location of:

1. an object located inside of something else (box, bag, cupboard)

    * De kikker zit in de koffer.
    * Er zit koffie in het kopje.
    * De jongens zitten in de klas.

2. a person or animal that is explicitly sitting down

    * De kinderen zitten op de bank.

_Liggen_ means "to lie" and is used to describe the location of:

1. an object lying on its side, or such that it is wider than it is tall.

    * Het boek ligt op de tafel.
    * De handdoeken liggen op de grond.

2. a geographical area or feature (country, mountain, city, park, etc.)

    * Nederland ligt ten noorden van Frankrijk.
    * Die stad ligt in België.

3. a person or animal that is explicitly lying down or dead

    * Zij ligt in het gras.

_Staan_ means "to stand" and is used to describe the location of:

1. an object that is right way up, or such that it is taller than it is wide.

    * Het bord staat op de tafel.
    * Het boek staat op de plank

2. an object resting on its legs or wheels (table, car)

    * De auto staat in die straat

3. text or images, meaning they stand on whatever surface they are displayed on

    * De woorden staan op de muur
    * Mijn foto staat in de krant

4. buildings, unless it's a complex of buildings or it includes some land around it, then _liggen_ can also be used

    * Het huis staat in Amsterdam
    * Het vliegveld ligt ten westen van Londen

5. a person or animal that is explicitly standing up

    * De man staat naast de vrouw

_Zijn_ means "to be" and it _can_ be used in some circumstances such as:

* the location of an event
* the location of a person or animal that isn't explicitly standing, sitting, or lying down, or whose posture is unknown
* if the emphasis is on the object's existence rather than its position

There are corresponding verbs for putting an object in its location for each of the aforementioned verbs used to describe their location.

| Action                  | Result                 |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------- |
| leggen x                | x liggen               |
| zetten x                | x staan                |
