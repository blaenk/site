You can find my contact information at the [bottom of this page](#footer).

üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I am a versatile, self-directed engineer with +3 years of professional experience and +16 years of overall software engineering experience.

üöÄ I consistently clear obstacles. If something is broken or lacking, I dive in to investigate, file a thorough ticket, and most of the time fix or implement the feature myself (see example [issue](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues/10921) and [PR](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/pull/10922)), and if what I need doesn't exist yet, [I will build it](https://github.com/blaenk/hoedown#readme).

üêû I love the thrill of the chase of debugging. This has led me to diagnose and address subtle and elusive bugs in all manner of previously-unfamiliar, complex, and diverse projects (see below), and all have been tremendous learning opportunities.

üßòüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I am practical. I dive deep into niches like emacs, vim, and zsh (see extensive [dotfiles](https://github.com/blaenk/dots)), or state-of-the-art technologies like Rust, or perspective-expanding technologies like Haskell and Clojure‚Äîbut I always remain grounded and pick the right tool for the job even if others may consider it boring. I always appreciate what each tool has to offer and its trade-offs.

üëÄ I keep up with the latest developments and constantly read and learn new things, preferring source material like documentation and manuals, if available. See my extensive [notes](/notes/) and my recent [reading list](/reads/).

‚ö° I dive deep into unfamiliar projects and quickly make meaningful contributions (see below).

üë∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I have a proven record for designing, planning, leading, and developing complex projects from the ground up.

## Origin

### TLDR

I was computer illiterate until I was 11, when, while on the job with my dad (carpentry; real work, not just sitting around), during lunch, having nothing else to entertain me over the course of the many days I was there, I would flip through a "computer part ad magazine" (no content, just ads) that my dad got, and began to infer what parts were critical to a working computer and where to find them cheapest. I struck a deal with my dad to earn money to build our first computer.

I accomplished this soon after turning 12 and next I began to wonder how graphical applications were made: what caused a button to react to a click? Eventually, during one of my first few times on the Internet (itself a feat made possible by free AOL trials), I came across a post using words I had _never_ heard before: Visual Studio, C++, source code, compiler. I was extremely intrigued and wanted to learn everything I could about "programming."

I couldn't ~~get ripped off by Game Stop~~ sell my video games quickly enough to buy used programming books, to my little brother's horror.

### Motivation

I was computer illiterate before the age of 12. All of my life I had largely avoided computers, aside from specific instances in school when we were given time to work with them. This was the result of being warned and scolded away from them for fear that I break them since they were expensive.

In third grade, my teacher, school principal, and other faculty worked with my parents to get me into a coveted magnet school through my grades. This school was attended by mostly well-off kids, so it was normal to expect homework assignments with even one day turnaround times to be neatly typed and printed.

I was at a point in school where computers were a necessity. Without a computer, I had to go to the library to type up school assignments, which wasn't always possible on the more frequent short-notice assignments. Otherwise I had to write my assignments in _perfect_ inked cursive. I was forced to appease draconian requirements which demanded no mistakes at all---no white-out allowed.

I was the only student in my class at my well-off magnet school without a computer capable of producing neat computer-printed assignments. It was as if I was inconveniencing _the teacher_, rather than it being my inconvenience that I couldn't afford a computer and had to endure the toil as a result: while other students could lazily type up assignments in a matter of minutes, I had to meticulously obsess over my writing.

This led to many late nights, many rewrites, and stress---because I always cared for doing things right in school. I was tired of it and embarrassed for not being "with the times."

### Action

One of the times I was out on a construction job with my dad I noticed a computer ad magazine during lunch. Having nothing else to distract me, I began to read through it and---over the next few days on the job with no other form of entertainment---I naturally began to draw connections between prices and components. This gave me an idea of which parts were critical to a working computer and which weren't, which were the best parts for the money, and which places had them the cheapest. This was important considering we previously couldn't afford one.

Armed with this information, I struck a deal with my dad which consisted of me keeping my grades up in school and helping him out at work for a few months so that I may earn the money needed for a cheap, custom built computer.

Eventually when I was 12 I did earn and build my computer, but over time I grew bored when I didn't think there was much more to learn about them beyond building one. I was always extremely curious though: what made a "window" react to a click? What put things together in a window and made it work the way it did?

### Taste

During this time we didn't have Internet most of the time except for the short breaths of air that I called free AOL trial periods, and even then I was rarely allowed to actually use it since it prevented phone calls from going through. On one of those rare opportunities I noticed an article on how to get started with "modding"---an unfamiliar term---the game that I loved to play offline: Star Wars: Jedi Outcast. The example was to write a mod to slow down the speed at which rockets from a rocket launcher traveled at. They used words I had never heard before such as Visual Studio, compiler, C++, source code, and so on.

I distinctly remember a part of the article that talked about editing some line in some "source code" that apparently had the literal effect of slowing down the rocket! Kids often wondered how games were made, and this article was nonchalantly talking about _modifying_ an existing game I loved. This blew my mind. This was around the time that the Matrix sequels were in theatres (in 2003, I was 13), and so out of ignorance I naturally imagined that this article was explaining how to get into something similar to the Matrix of the game. I felt a deep urge to understand all of it.

### Programming

I felt an intense desire to learn everything about "programming," something I didn't even know existed. I felt as though it was a secret ability or language which unlocked great power. I didn't have access to YouTube, Wikipedia, role models, I didn't even know anyone who programmed, not even parents of friends or anything like that. I was entirely on my own.

The only thing I could think to do, and did, was to sell my video games in order to buy used programming books, knowing full well Game Stop was ripping me off. I still remember my poor little brother lamenting me selling my video games to buy what looked to him like dry, boring books. I also remember making the innocent mistake of buying a C++ for Dummies book with a typo in the first code listing and being stumped for weeks.

Overall, however, I was on the fast track. I became a voracious reader and sold more and more of my video games to buy books, and when I sold all of the ones that I was willing to sell, I would find other ways of making money to buy more books.

### Internet

This also made me realize that I could save a lot of money if I could get access to the Internet, so I began to the long process of convincing my parents that it was a necessary cost and one that would pay huge dividends.

Once I finally got access, I consumed anything and everything.
