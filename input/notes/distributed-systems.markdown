Software can be considered to be reliable when it continues to work correctly even when things go wrong. The things that can go wrong are _faults_, so a system that anticipates faults and can cope with them are known as fault-tolerant or resilient.

Scalability is a system's ability to cope with increased load. In other words, if a system grows a particular way, what options are available to cope with that growth.

Load is often described by load parameters, such as requests per second to a webserver, ratio of reads to writes in a database, etc.

For example, Twitter's scalability challenge was with respect to its fan-out, where each user follows many other users, and each user is followed by many people. Requesting a user's home timeline can be accomplished in two main ways.

Look up all of the people they follow, find all of their recent tweets, and then merge them sorted by time.

``` postgresql
SELECT tweets.*, users.* FROM tweets
  JOIN users ON tweets.sender_id = users.id
  JOIN follows ON follows.followee_id = users.id
WHERE follows.follower_id = current_user;
```

Maintain a cache for each user's home timeline, like a queue. When a user posts a tweet, insert the new tweet into the home timeline cache of each user that follows them.

The second, queue approach is more efficient in Twitter's case because the average rate of published tweets is almost two orders of magnitude lower than the rate of home timeline reads, so it's preferable to do more work at write time than at read time.

The problem is that the number of followers per user highly varies, with an average of 75 followers, but others with more than 30 million followers, and there is a time constraint of delivering tweets to followers within 5 seconds. In this case, the distribution of followers per user, perhaps weighted by tweet frequency, is a useful load parameter since it corresponds to fan-out load. To compensate for this variability, Twitter is moving to a hybrid of both approaches, so that a small number of users with a very large number of followers are excepted from the queue approach. Instead, when a user requests their home timeline, the tweets from such celebrities followed by the user are fetched separately and merged with the regular queue approach.

Given load parameters, a system's scalability can be analyzed by increasing a load parameter and:

* with fixed system resources, and observing the system's performance
* determining how to increase system resources to maintain the same level of performance

Throughput is the number of records that can be processed per second, or the total time it takes to run a job on a dataset of a certain size.

A service's response time is the time between a client sending a request and receiving a response. The response time is what the client sees, which includes the time to process the request (service time) and network and queuing delays.

Response time should be thought of as a distribution of measurable values, not a single value, because individual response times may vary, either due to heavier requests, or random additional latency introduced by a context switch, TCP retransmission, garbage collection pause, etc.

To get an idea of a typical response time, it's better to use percentiles than an arithmetic mean.

Higher percentiles are even more important in backend services that are called multiple times as part of serving a single end-user request, since, even if they're called in parallel, the end-user has to wait for the slowest of the calls to complete. Even if only a small percentage of backend calls are slow, the chance of getting a slow call increases with an increase in backend calls, so a higher proportion of end-user requests end up being slow.

Latency is the duration that a request is waiting to be handled, during which it is latent (awaiting service).

An architecture is unlikely to cope with ten times its usual load, so it may be necessary to re-think an architecture of a fast-growing service at least on every order of magnitude load increase, if not more.

A shared nothing architecture is one in which load is distributed across multiple machines.

Elastic systems are ones that can automatically add computing resources when they detect a load increase, instead of manually.

It's important to avoid premature optimization for scaling to some hypothetical future load, since, if the assumptions for common operations and load parameters end up being wrong, the time will be wasted or counter-productive. Quicker iteration should be emphasized.
