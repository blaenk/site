This page lists some of the things that I've been up to lately. I try my best to keep it up-to-date.

## Reading

At any moment I have a handful of books that I'm currently reading. I find that I don't have trouble keeping track of each, thanks in part to keeping [notes](/notes/), and having a set of books allows me to switch to something else temporarily if a particular book falls into a lull. I also keep a page of reviews of [books that I've finished](/reads/).

[Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Data-Intensive-Applications-Reliable-Maintainable/dp/1449373321/) [[notes](/notes/scalability)] --- I've always been interested in the scalability of large scale, data-intensive systems. I read this book since way back when it was unfinished and in early access, but my Kindle randomly decided to lose all of the notes and highlights I had made.

Now I'm going through and re-reading it a second time. This book is amazing.
