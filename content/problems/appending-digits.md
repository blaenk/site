It's possible to "shift" a number to the left by `$n$` digits by multiplying it with `$\text {base}^\text {n digits}$`. For example, the number `$321$` can be shifted to the left by 2 digits to `$32100$` by multiplying it by `$10^2$`.

<div>$$\text {shifted left by n} = x * \text {base}^\text {n digits}$$</div>
