Given a string containing an alien alphabet in lexicographical order, determine whether an array of strings is in order.

# Reflection

* \+ [Used abstractions](/notes/problem-solving/#use-abstractions)

    Separating out the functions made the implementation clearer.

* \- [Bottom-up driven](/notes/problem-solving/#work-top-bottom)

    I think I could've been faster and things would've been clearer if I had worked top-bottom.

* Â± [Prematurely optimized the order hash](/notes/problem-solving/#premature-optimization)

    It worked out in the end and I don't think it took away too much, but engaging in premature optimization can be precarious.
